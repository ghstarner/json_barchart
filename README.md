# json_barchart
A simple example of using Flutter to retrieve data from a REST server and display it as a barchart.

To use create a new project in flutter or Android Studio and copy over the main.dart file to the lib directory and the pubspec.yaml to the parent directory. Then do a "flutter packages get" to retrieve the dependencies.

To run the exmaple you must also start the load.py on your server. This requires installing Flask and then doing a "python load.py" to run the server.
